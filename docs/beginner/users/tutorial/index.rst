EPFL Beginner Tutorial
======================

The tutorial currently consists of two parts.

In the first part, a simple EPFL notes app is created in which notes can be created and displayed.

In the second part, the notes app is extended with more powerful features (such as nested notes) and EPFL concepts (such as a tree view).
