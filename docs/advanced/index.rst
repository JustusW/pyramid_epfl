Join the EPFL Devs
==================

In complex projects you will sometimes find a task or activity that can not be done using pre existing EPFL Components.
That's no reason to despair however, building an EPFL Component is easy! Whatever you want to do, tweak an existing
component slightly, use it as core to a more complex component or create something completely new, this is the place for
you to learn how to do it!
