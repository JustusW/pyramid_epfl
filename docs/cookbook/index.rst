The EPFL Cookbook
#################

There's a lot you'd want from an EPFL App, and some things can become pretty complicated. To make it easier for the
beginner we've assembled some common recipes most apps need at one time or another. Just take a peek, if you need
something else feel free to ask for it!

All recipes are starting from a clean install of the starter scaffold, so just create one via:

.. code-block:: bash

    pcreate -s pyramid_epfl_starter example_recipe

Unless specified otherwise all code examples belong in the epfl_pyramid_barebone/views/home.py

.. toctree::

    routing/index
    layout/index
