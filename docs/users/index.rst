This part of the documentation is intended for complete newbees to EPFL to be read step by step. After that you shoud be able to write your own webapp with EPFL. Sometimes this documentation goes in to detail which can be read afterwards - if you go throu this while developing more complex applications where you need a little bit more insight. After that I recommend to read the developers-part of this documentation, if you want to have more information or if you just want to know what is going on "under the hood".

The components-part is also good as reference.
